Release branch should contain installer for a specific system. The installer should be tested on a clean operating systeand bug free. 
Currently we have Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04 releases. In the future we may add more. 

* Whhen a new release is created, we add the date. 
* When a complete version is created we add a tag e.g. 4.1.0.01, the first part is related to the opensim-core version used.
